If you want to deploy your changes to the actual site, then you should make your changes (or merge them) in main
and then run `npm run deploy`

## Making posts

If you want to make a post, then make a new markdown file in `src/markdown-pages` and throw any images into
`src/markdown-pages/post-images`
